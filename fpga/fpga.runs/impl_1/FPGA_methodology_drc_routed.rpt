2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP and clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP] -to [get_clocks clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP_1 and clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin pll/pll/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_CLK_WIZ_IP, clkfbout_CLK_WIZ_IP_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin pll/pll/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT2 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP, clk_out3_CLK_WIZ_IP_1
Related violations: <none>
